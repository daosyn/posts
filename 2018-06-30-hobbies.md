Platforms like Discord and Reddit make it extremely easy to form niche interest groups. Of course, in the early years of the Internet there were still ways to connect with people, such as Internet Relay Chat, imageboards, and various Internet forums. What gives the former two an advantage over the older platforms is that they take previous concepts and unify groups into one central hub, allowing for ease of use, intermingling, and more publicity. Today, a quick search of a particular hobby or interest will typically result in a few hits linking to a Subreddit, a community that is a subset of the rest of Reddit. These Subreddits often focus on a single interest, allowing for fans of that interest to share photos or host discussions. These Subreddits also often link to their own Discord server, which people can join to communicate in real time with the same people. Where previously one would have to get someone else to invite them to a forum or share server details to an IRC channel, now that same person can seek out the community themselves and join as desired. The platform is less secretive and more open to everyone.

Is this such a good thing?

There exists certain downsides to such an open community. Because there is less exclusivity and more people in general, there is a much higher ratio of people who end up being too extreme; that is, there are people who are too vocal in their opinions of things that leaves a bad taste in the mouths of the public. It ends up being that old niche communties also look down on this newer platform because some of the more vocal people post hivemind opinions or are ill-informed in some regard.

The positives are good, however. It is so easy nowadays to find several other related interests and develop personal hobbies. The entry level into hobbies is very low, and it is easy to move on if the hobby does not stick.

If one can look past the overly popular Subreddits and find niche communities within Reddit (have I gone full circle?), I think that, overall, Reddit is a very useful tool for enabling personal interests.
