It would seem that in this day and age of the Internet, people can constantly find themselves something to do to occupy their purposeless but satisfying lives in this world. However, it is quite the opposite. There is simply an overabundance of options which causes one to become totally uncertain whether one option is a better choice than the other. It becomes so easy to get lost in that metaphorical fig tree that the main character describes in The Bell Jar. It becomes so easy to get lost in a depression and end up not doing anything.

Advances in technology (smartphones) and social media are not the only culprits, but these two things have made the biggest impact on how people interact with each other nowadays. Everything has become so generated, so artificial, performed for the masses rather than oneself.

There has to be some sort of balance that can solve this sort of restlessness in the younger generation.

Today's modern day utopia is just the next big phone app idea.
