I fell for it.

Older ThinkPads are so nice right now because they cost very little and are still very capable machines. Companies are phasing old models out and the ones with amazing keyboards are present in surplus on eBay and the like for less than a couple hundred.

Currently I am trying to get OpenBSD set up on an x220 I just received, in an effort to have an isolated development environment. Similarly to how getting books and a Kobo eReader allowed me to solely focus on reading books, I want to set this machine up in such a way that allows me to focus exclusively on various coding projects I have wanted to pursue for a while now and yet neglected due to the many distractions that exist on the Internet.

Anyway, I have only just gotten `dwm` set up with the basics. I still have a long way to go.
